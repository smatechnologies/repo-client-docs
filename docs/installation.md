# Installation
The installation of the Repo Client consists of extracting the information from the zip file into a folder on the system, configuring the Connector.config file and creating the required repositories in the selected environment. The extracted data contains all the required files and the Java version (for Windows) required to execute the Repo Client CLI.

If the target installation is to be a Linux system, the appropriate Linux Java 11 Open JDK must be downloaded and installed in the /java folder.
The following repoclient.sh can be created 

```
#!/bin/bash
SCRIPT_DIR=$(dirname "$0")
cd $SCRIPT_DIR
java -cp repo-client.jar com.smatechnologies.repo.client.RepoCLI "$@"Â´

```
## Encryption

Certain information needs to be stored encrypted in files The **Encrypt.exe** utility must be used to encrypt the information and the encrypted value
should be copied into the file.

```
Encrypt.exe -v "abc"

[10:31:04] [INFO ] --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
[10:31:04] [INFO ] EncryptValue          : Version 23.0.0 
[10:31:04] [INFO ] --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
[10:31:04] [INFO ] -v  (value)           : abc 
[10:31:04] [INFO ] --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
[10:31:04] [INFO ] ev : 59574a6a
